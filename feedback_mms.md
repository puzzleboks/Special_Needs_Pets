# Feedback from Matt (mms)

## Project Workflow: How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

Exceed expectations: Nice readme.  Provided everything I needed.  It was good to see the progression through your commits and migrations.

## Technical Requirements: How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

Exceed expectations: you pushed the boundaries and struggled with multiple models, relationships, and how to create a flow to support these.

## Creativity / Interface: How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

Meets expectations:  good effort to wrangle the multiple layers.  Just remember, the routes control the interface, not the implementation. You could nest treatments within a pet (for routes).

## Code Quality: How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?

Meet expectations: Clean, well formatted code.  Nothing surprising.  Please see Pull request.

## Deployment and Functionality: How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

Meets expectations:  Deployed?  Check.  No errors?  Check.  Visual separation can get a bit muddy sometimes.

## Conclusion

A solid entry.  Good job with your expectations and progression.  You should be proud of your effort and results.
